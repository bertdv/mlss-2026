# Introduction: CCD Data

In _Observational Astronomy_, scientists use optical equipment to learn more about the universe. Often, a **telescope** is used, together with a **CCD**, a digital image sensor. The telescope can magnify and focus star light, and these photons hit different pixels of the CCD surface.

The CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) is a small rectangular grid of photosensitive pixels. During an exposure period, it counts **the number of photons** that hit every pixel of its surface.

details("But what about color?", md"""

CCDs are also used in digital cameras, with the modification that individual CCD pixels have color filters (red, green, blue) in a regular pattern. These values are displayed by corresponding colored lights on a digital screen.

In astronomy, a CCD-telescope can be used in combination with filters. A filter (e.g. a "red" filter) is placed in front of the CCD, to only capture light of a specific wavelength. By taking a series of images with different filters, you can infer knowledge of the spectrum of light emitted by a star.

In this assignment, we will only consider images taken through the same filter.

# Part 1: CCD calibration

_3 points_


The CCD circuit uses a digital amplifier, to measure photons with very high sensitivity. This setup is able to pick up individual photons, but there is also noise introduced in the amplifier gain process. This gain noise (aka _thermal noise_ or _dark current_) is a constant background level of noise that is added to every pixel's reading.

Because the level of gain noise is temperature-dependent, it is important to calibrate this for every study. Usually, before making observations (i.e. taking star pictures), you take some calibration images:
1. **Dark frame** - you take a picture of the same exposure time as your observation (e.g. 60 seconds), but **with the lid on** the telescope. This means no star light is measured, only CCD noise.
2. **Flat field** _(not in this assignment)_ – you take a picture of a uniform light source, e.g. the inside of the telescope dome with the lights on, a picture of the sky taken during twilight (so-called _sky flat_). This measures pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations and vignetting (uneven illumination).
3. **Science frame** – the actual image of the celestial object.

Now that we can calibrate the thermal noise of our image, we can properly analyse our science image. We want to know more about the star captured in the frame, like its position and luminosity.

A simple way to start analysing the position is to take a **1D slice** of the image (a single row). If our slice passes close to the star, we should see a localized bump.
